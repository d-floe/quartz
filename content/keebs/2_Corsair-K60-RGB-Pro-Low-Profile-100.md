## Corsair K60 RGB Pro Low Profile

- Time Owned: 3 days

### Summary

This keyboard made two things abundantly clear: I don't like right side numpads, and I can't use speed switches. I remember making a lot of typos on this thing.
The Pudding keycaps on these were so cheap and rough feeling that it for a time turned me off from PBT for a while.

> [!fail] Cons
>
> -   I learned that full-sized boards are too long for me to use, I need that mouse space on the right.
>
> -   I learned that speed/low profile switches are too sensitive for me to use. Not a fan.

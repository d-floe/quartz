## Sharkeneko

- Received: May 4th, 2023
- Weight (built): 1474g / 3.25lbs

### Summary

My baby, my ultimate daily driver. This board feels, sounds, and looks exactly how I want and is maxed out in customization to my liking. Everything in this build culminates to a very clacky, loud typing experience without compromising on the low or high ends. If I had to type on one board for the rest of my life it'd probably be this.

### Original Concept

### Parts

- [x] Case: black anodized aluminum
- [x] Configuration: [Geon 3.5mm Poron LE-20, Soft Plate Foam](https://keebsforall.com/products/geon-keyboard-foams-for-tkl?variant=43926766026971) in lower case
    - I got the idea from Alexotos' Mode Sonnet build. It seems to act as a middle ground dampener between shelf liner and a thick poron sheet.
    - The sound is improved over no dampening, and the typing feel is unaffected.

### Brass Patina

The clear coat on the brass weight started to show signs of Patina. I wasn't sure what had stripped the clear-coating off the weight, but I figured that if was to get patina on my weight, I might as well make the patina look beautiful. I commissioned [LoobedSwitches](https://loobedswitches.com/) to strip the clear coat off my brass weight, and apply a rainbow patina to it inspired by these images:

I eagerly await the result. These patina jobs look stellar.

> Spots started to develop on weight, force patina in future or look up ways to clean with lemon juice maybe?? Find someone who can do really cool rainbow patina on brass too like kneedeeppatinas.
> it'd be pretty sweet to have a rainbow patina on the bottom [dayum](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChXimANOcWH/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
> I ended up commissioning Loobedswitches to do a forced patina on my brass weight. They seem to have done one before so I'm excited to see the results. Should take about two to three weeks to get done.

## OwLab Voice Mini

- Received: September 29th, 2023
- Weight (built): 230g

### Summary

Its a pretty good macropad! I like that it has wireless capability so there's no need for a clunky cord. I can effortlessly move this to different places on my desk as I want.
The build experience was enjoyable; though the QK Configurator leaves a little to be desired. For instance, there doesn't appear to be any sort of mod-tap functionality, which means you need a key dedicated to changing layers. Originally I wanted the FN key to act as "play/pause" when tapped and a layer key when held.

> [!note]
> If you intend on using the Bluetooth mod, make sure you have the "Mode" and "BT1" functions bound on some sort of accessible layer.
> I made the mistake of not having the mode switch bound while stuck in bluetooth mode, and I couldn't reconfigure my bindings, so I had to reset the pcb and flash new firmware via the reset pins on the back.

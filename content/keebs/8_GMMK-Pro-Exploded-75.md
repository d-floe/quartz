### Summary

I don't quite remember a lot about this keyboard. I remember modding this board a bunch in my attempts to reach "peak bounciness" but I think the reason I ended up selling this board was that I wasn't a big fan of the sandblasted finish of the case. The lack of proper VIA support was a bit of a turn off, but I did get my first experience with QMK trying to get the lightbar on the sides to the colors I wanted. There was a lot of hype around this board and I quite liked the RGB sideglow.

> -   They still don't sell PCBs for this board wtf.
> -   Basically no room for bounce

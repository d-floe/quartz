## Reproduction Model F62 Classic

### Summary

I decided to order a the Classic style case for the Model F62 from Model F Labs and I do not regret my decision. This build sports the classic "pearl and pebble" keycaps from Model F Labs. The legends and key feel is much more quality and refined than Unicomp's keycaps. The board is also incredibly heavy because the chassis is made entirely out of cast zinc. I thought the [[22_Ultra-Compact-Model-F62|Ultra Compact]] case was heavy, but this is in another league of its own.

I cant comment on the sound of it yet, simply because I didn't know to order a different mounting plate and the classic case didn't come with one, so for now the assembly is just sitting inside the case loosely.

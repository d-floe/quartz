## Drop CTRL

- Received: June 3rd, 2021
- Returned: June 22nd, 2021
- Time Owned: 19 Days

### Summary

I'm very grateful I opted to return this keyboard because it was not only really expensive but also kind of a ripoff for what you got. In retrospect, the only interesting thing about this board was the USB Pass through feature. Everything else about this was way overpriced.
While yes, it was full aluminum and hot swap, the major downsides included:

- North facing sockets
- 3 pin sockets
- Plate mounted stabilizers
- Integrated plate
- RGB issues with coiled cables due to ridiculous power draw
- Spotty RGB under glow
- No VIA compatibility (at the time)
- A very hollow chassis with no included dampening

The options available for In-Stock TKLs were really limited at the time, and at the time I thought this was the best I could get.

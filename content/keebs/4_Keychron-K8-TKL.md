### Summary

This keyboard was my gateway into keyboard modding. Since this board was hot swap, I was able to experiment with different switches and mods, such as adding foam into the case. This was the era before PE foam and tape mod, so modding options were rather limited, but it was fun. I ended up returning this board and opting to try something more expensive and "high-end."

> [!check] Pros
>
> -   First time modding a keyboard beyond changing the keycaps! I didn't have the patience to do any sort of lubing or anything but getting the opportunity to change out the switches to find my preference was a great step in the right direction.

> [!fail] Cons
>
> -   Felt cheap, I wasn't a big fan of the "framed" design of the chassis.
> -   The USB port being on the left side was weird to me.
> -   The sound of the board wasn't anything to write home about.

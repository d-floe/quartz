## Corsair K65 LUX RGB

- Received: October 29th, 2018
- Trashed: mid 2021
- Duration Owned: 3 Years

### Summary

This was my very first mechanical keyboard before I knew anything about mechanical keyboards. It served me well for the time I had it, though it was honestly not a good keyboard in hindsight, but I guess we all start somewhere. This so far has been the single keyboard I've owned the longest. The space bar sounds so unbelievably rattly that it might as well be a clicky switch. I don't remember how the MX Red RGBs felt but considering I switched to tactile switches pretty shortly after them probably gives an idea of how they felt.

> [!fail] Cons

> -   Gaming keyboards suck
> -   Cheap ABS keycaps get gross
> -   No lubing on the stabilizers whatsoever
> -   Very scratchy "Pretooled" (1995-2017) MX Reds

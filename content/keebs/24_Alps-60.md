### Parts

- [x] Case: black anodized aluminum
- [x] Configuration: [Geon 3.5mm Poron LE-20, Soft Plate Foam](https://keebsforall.com/products/geon-keyboard-foams-for-tkl?variant=43926766026971) in lower case
    - I got the idea from Alexotos' Mode Sonnet build. It seems to act as a middle ground dampener between shelf liner and a thick poron sheet.
    - The sound is improved over no dampening, and the typing feel is unaffected.

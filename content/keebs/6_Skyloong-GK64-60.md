### Summary

Got this board shortly before returning my Drop CTRL. I don't specifically remember where I got the idea to buy this board but I think I was inspired by all the modding videos for this board specifically. The GH60 form factor is extremely versatile and leaves many doors open for part swapping. I had a lot of fun with this keyboard.

> [!check] Pros
>
> -   Lots of fun modding potential!
> -   My first run in with 60% keyboards, which is currently my favorite form-factor.
> -   GH60 layout gives many avenues for expansion by letting you swap out effectively every component for in-stock replacements.

> [!fail] Cons
>
> -   PCB had probably one of the worst software for rebinding that I've experienced so far.
> -   The interchangeable space bar plate seems cool in theory, but I would have preferred if it was one piece to limit the usage of standoffs. The spacebar plate standoffs are basically required if you want to use the steel plate that it came with.
> -   The stock config left a lot to be desired but it's easily mitigated.

## Pikatea Macropad GB4

- Received: December 5th, 2022

### Summary

I got this macro pad to serve 4 needs:

- Fast volume control
- A microphone mute button
- A discord deafen button
- A toggle RGB button for my PC

Building this was initially a pain because I attempted to use [[keebs/misc/7305-0-Gold-Sockets|Millmax Sockets]]; however, the assembly was effectively held together by the switches, so soldering directly to the PCB was necessary. Originally I had [[keebs/switches/Kailh-Box-Jade|Kailh Box Jade]] switches in this, but the translucent top housing looked garish compared to the black top housing of [[keebs/switches/JWK-Black-T1|JWK Black T1]] switches.

Simple and effective!

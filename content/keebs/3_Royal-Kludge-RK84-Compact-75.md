- Time Owned: 4 Days

### Summary

This is the only case where I have no photos of this keyboard. I made mock-ups of my ideal design for this build inspired by a design on WASD Keyboards, but I have no real pictures of this board. I returned it pretty soon after because I was turned off by how “cramped” the layout was.

> [!check] Pros
>
> -   My first try using tactile switches. I don't remember if I liked them but given that I used tactile switches for a while afterward, I assume I did.

> [!fail] Cons
>
> -   Definitely too compact for me. I had a hard time finding the arrow keys and function keys.

## Gazzew Boba U4

A very interesting silent tactile experience. I wish I remember how these feel but it's been a long time. It's probably better to use silent tactiles rather than silent linear switches because at least with a silent tactile you can have some sort of actuation feedback. Silent stuff isn't really my jam, though.

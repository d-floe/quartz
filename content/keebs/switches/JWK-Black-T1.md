## JWK Black T1

I needed a sharp tactile for my [[MACRO_Pikatea-Macropad-GB4|Pikatea Macropad GB4]] that had a dark housing. This was before I tried [[Cherry-Boba|Cherry Boba]]. These switches have notoriously bad leaf ping. I bought like 10 of these and only managed to save 3 or 4. These basically **require** [dielectric grease on the back of the leaf](https://youtu.be/6d7CZia7xY4?t=231), which is kind of insane to think about.

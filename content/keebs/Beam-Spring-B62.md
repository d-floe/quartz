## Beam Spring B62

### Introspective

When I was ordering some extra parts for my Model F Labs F62 keyboard, I decided to try out a single Beam Spring switch as a taste since I heard they were such a highly coveted switch. Oh boy, I was immediately hooked.

## The 1u Switch Assembly

I decided to make a simple stack mount housing for the single beam spring switch that I bought, since the switch on its own does not click without being pressed. I figured that something as simple as 2 pieces of FR4 held together by screws and spacers would do the trick so I pulled out my calipers, opened Adobe Illustrator and got to work.

Originally the plan was to make the plates from 26.282 mm squares with 3mm holes at the corners, and a 15mm hole in the top like so:

In my naivety, I simply assumed that those specifications would work perfectly fine without any interference issues, so I went ahead and ordered these as plates from JLCPCB.

I later decided to go into Fusion360 and verify that the parts that I ordered would work.

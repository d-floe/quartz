## TL;DR

- Color precision when your screens match.
- You PROBABLY don't need perfect color accuracy.
- Calibration is confusing and here's [[art/color-precision#Chapter 3 Calibration|how to do it.]]
- Color management is messy and it sucks.

## What is color precision?

Before talking about color precision, it's important that we make a distinction between **precision** and **accuracy**. Precision is all about getting consistent results, while accuracy is about getting correct results. Precision and accuracy work well hand in hand, but aren't mutually correlated. For the sake of this guide, we will be prioritizing precision over accuracy.

**Color accuracy** is when the colors on all your monitors are as close to “perceptually correct” as possible. Accuracy doesn't necessarily mean that the colors on each monitor will match each other. If you're using different monitors with different color accuracy, the colors on each monitor will show up differently, despite each monitor attempting to display colors as accurately as possible.

**Color precision** is when colors on all of your monitors are matching each other as close as possible. This does not typically require very expensive monitors, however, _you will always be limited by the least color capable monitor in your setup._

![[color-precision-1.png]]

## So which one do you want?

In a perfect world, with the perfect professional setup, with perfectly color managed software, you could achieve precise and accurate outputs that exactly match the input color data. In the real world, this is especially tempting for professional photographers and video editors who work very hard to make sure the colors that they're working with are accurate and exactly how they should appear in the most ideal scenarios; however, for 99 percent of people and digital artists, you may want to **maximize color precision** at the expense of color accuracy.

There's nothing quite as frustrating as finishing a drawing you produced tirelessly on one screen, and then dragging it over into another monitor to find out that the colors are completely different. Believe me. I've probably wasted at least a hundred cumulative hours attempting to get the colors of my illustrations to look right on all 3 of my monitors. This is why color precision is so important.

## Chapter 0: Is this worth the investment?

If color precision has never bothered you, I welcome you to click off this guide and continue to live in blissful ignorance. Trust me, it is **far** better to not care if you don't already care; however, if you are cursed with the knowledge that your colors do not match, welcome to the club.

It is technically possible to achieve color precision for free through [a very headache inducing process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avJTz1JhkR4); however, I recommend renting or buying some sort of colorimeter that works with [DisplayCAL](https://displaycal.net/). I use a Spyder X Pro; though, there are potentially better options out there.

I had trouble getting DisplayCAL working with my Spyder X Pro due to Argyll 2.3.1 not functioning properly with that device. If you have a Spyder X Pro or intend on getting one, you may need to use **Argyll 2.3.0** instead.

## Chapter 1: White points

The **white point** of your monitor is one of the most crucial things to get right when attempting to match the colors on all of your monitors. The white point is essentially the deciding factor for how the color temperature and tint your colors are. Do your grays feel too warm? Too cold? Too purple? Too green? How your white point is set will ultimately decide how the resulting color will look to your eyes.

> [!warning] Important
>
> White points are perceptually different based on the lighting of your environment. Ideally, you will want to match the white point of your monitor to the lighting of your room.

The color temperature of light is measured in Kelvin, based on the temperature and light output of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation). All you really need to know is the higher the temperature in kelvin, the cooler the color of light gets, which can be a little counter-intuitive.

![[color-precision-8.png]]

A lot of sources tend to disagree on what classifies as “daylight,” “soft white,” or “neutral” light. The important thing is to pay attention to the color temperature in Kelvin.

If you use 5000K daylight bulbs in your room, you might want to set your white point to the 6500K photography standard.

![[color-precision-2.png]]

> Example of how 6500K light is perceived under **daylight** bulbs. The grays are perfectly neutral with the environment.

If your room uses a warmer light bulbs, 6500K may end up looking too cold, and it may help to set your white point to something warmer such as the 5000K graphic arts industry standard.

![[color-precision-6.png]]

> Example of how 6500K light is perceived under **soft light** bulbs. The grays are too cool and leans toward cyan and blue.

![[color-precision-5.png]]

> Example of how 5000K light is perceived under **soft light** bulbs. The grays are adjusted to the environment and are perceptually neutral again.

## Chapter 2: Brightness / White Level

Another big part of color precision is maintaining consistent brightness across each monitor. Not all monitors are capable of outputting the same brightness and this can cause issues where colors will not look right.

We will need to lower our brightness on the other monitors to match the monitor with the weakest peak brightness.

![[color-precision-7.png]]

I personally find that calibrating my monitors for **190cd/m²** generally grants the best results for my environment, however you will need to play around to find what brightness works best for your eyes and your environment.

## Chapter 3: Calibration

Now that we understand these basic concepts, let's talk about colorimeters.

**Colorimeters** are devices that are specifically designed to sense the light coming off of a monitor. They are the best solution for getting your colors as **accurate** as possible. Colorimeters do this by interfacing with **calibration software** such as DisplayCAL by sending information about the light emitted from your monitor. From there, the calibration software will generate a file called an **ICC profile,** which adjusts the colors outputted by the computer to the monitor.

![[color-precision-9.png]]

Each monitor will need its own unique color profile to display colors as accurately as possible. Calibration can take roughly 10–20 minutes.

If you have not installed [DisplayCAL](https://displaycal.net/), make sure to do so and any required drivers. You may need to look up how to set it up to work with your colorimeter, setup differs wildly depending on the colorimeter you use.

### Getting started

1. Start off by plugging your colorimeter into your PC. Make sure it connects directly to the computer instead of a USB hub or secondary device.
2. Start DisplayCAL and make sure your colorimeter is detected, and you have the correct monitor selected. You might need to experiment with which “Mode” works best for you, but don't worry if you only have one option.

![[color-precision-10.png]]

4. Click on the calibration tab and set your desired settings. Always set the tone curve to `Gamma 2.2` and turn on `Interactive display adjustment`.

![[color-precision-11.png]]

5. Now click `Calibrate & profile` at the bottom of the window. Make sure the calibration window shows up on the correct monitor. If it does not show up, make sure to cancel and try another monitor in step 2. Sometimes monitors will just show up as `Generic PnP Monitor` instead of the actual name of the monitor.

![[color-precision-12.png]]

6. Click `Start measurement` and follow the prompt. This window will likely show up on your main monitor. Feel free to drag it over after following the prompts on screen.

![[color-precision-13.png]]

7. Make sure to tilt the monitor up, so the colorimeter is flush with the screen to minimize light leak.

![[color-precision-14.png]]

8. Now for the most involved part of the process:
   Click `Start measurement` and wait for the window to start showing the white point bars. You will need to adjust your monitor's settings to line up the colors as close to both targets as possible.

![[color-precision-15.png]]

9. Open your monitor's **OSD** (on-screen display). You may need to go into the settings to reposition the OSD if it shows up in the middle of the screen. Navigate to the color temperature settings and use the user/custom setting. Your monitor's OSD may show different names and settings, so make sure to familiarize yourself with the layout.

![[color-precision-16.png]]

10. Edit your RGB settings. You may also need to adjust your backlight or brightness setting if the brightness is too light. If your monitor already has a backlight setting, do not adjust the brightness setting.

From my experience, green tends to affect the brightness the most. What you're attempting to do is balance the red, green, and blue bars on the calibrator until you reach the target white point. If for whatever reason, your monitor cannot meet the target white level, you may need to lower the white level in step 3.

![[color-precision-18.png]]![[color-precision-19.png]]

> [!caution] Important
>
> Try to keep your RGB settings near the middle value. Having RGB values too high or low can mess with the colors. If you absolutely must go further in one direction, it is better to subtract than add RGB values from the middle.

11. After meeting your targets in both white point and white level, click `Stop measurement` and then click `Continue on to calibration`.

![[color-precision-20.png]]

12. The hard part is over. Now just sit back and let DisplayCAL do its magic. This will take longer than you may expect.

![[color-precision-21.png]]

13. After the calibration is complete, click `Intall profile`. You are now finished. Repeat from step 2 for your other monitors.

![[color-precision-22.png]]

### Making sure your profile installed correctly

You can double-check that your monitor profile is on by right-clicking your desktop and going to `Display settings`.

![[color-precision-23.png]]

Click on the monitor you calibrated and check if the profile you made shows up in the `Color profile` drop down box. The profile name will also give useful information about the profile.

The name is of the profile, structured as follows:

```
<Monitor name> <Output number> <Year>-<Month>-<Day> <Hour>-<Minute> <White level> <White point> <Gamma curve> <Calibration speed>-<Profile quality> <Profile type>
```

This information will be useful for differentiating between multiple profiles in the future.

![[color-precision-24.png]]

### Color checking your profile

Once you've calibrated all your monitors, check your colors using a non-color-managed software such as MS Paint. Paste various images into the canvas and check to see if they look consistent between your monitors. If one of your monitors appear too saturated compared to the others, you can turn down the vibrance in your graphics card control panel.

![[color-precision-26.png]]

> [!note] Important Note
>
> Even though you color calibrated your monitor, this will not be the last time you will need to calibrate it. Over time the color on your monitors may change, so every few months you might need to recalibrate them.
>
> The process is much less of a headache after the first attempts since you likely wont need to fiddle with the OSD. Just recalibrate whenever the colors start bothering you. For most people, this will be a long time.
>
> Windows updates have also been known to break things so make sure to check that you're still using the same profile.

## Chapter 4: Color-Managed Software

Now that you have color profiles installed, let's talk about **color managed software.** Most software out there is **not** inherently color managed, and not all color managed software is managed the same. In order to achieve color precision, we need to limit the amount of color management done by color managed software. Otherwise, some software will not display colors the same as others, and it simply leads to compounding issues.

The standard color space for web content known as **sRGB.** Color managed software will attempt to take content such as images that are tagged for sRGB and adapt it to your monitor's color profile. The result of this now **non**-color managed software will display in **full vibrant color** and images in color-managed software will appear washed out and desaturated.

For color precision, **color management is bad.**

Left is Photoshop, a color managed program. Right is MS Paint, a non-color managed program.

The Photoshop image is desaturated and washed out. If you cannot tell the difference between the bottom two images, you probably do not need to worry about color management.

![[color-precision-27.png]]

This problem can have compounding negative effects.

When taking screenshots of Photoshop and pasting the screenshot back in, Photoshop assumes the image is sRGB and adjusts how the colors are displayed each time. The result demonstrates just how detrimental color management is for color precision.

![[color-precision-28.png]]

Here's how to fix this issue on various color managed software.

### Web Browsers

Below is an untagged CSS element on top of a tagged sRGB image. If you see any difference in each color vertically, your browser is currently color managed; otherwise, both reds should look the same, both greens should look the same, and both blues should look the same.

<div class="bars">
	<div class="red bar"></div>
	<div class="green bar"></div>
	<div class="blue bar"></div>
</div>

> If you have any extensions that mess with how websites are displayed such as Dark Reader, you may need to turn them OFF or disable them for this test.

#### Google Chrome

In Chrome, go to `chrome://flags/#force-color-profile` into your address bar, and set `Force color profile` to `sRGB`. Then, restart your browser.

![[color-precision-29.png]]

#### Microsoft Edge

In Edge, go to `edge://flags/#force-color-profile` into your address bar, and set `Force color profile` to `sRGB`. Then, restart your browser.

![[Pasted image 20230722051222.png]]

#### Firefox

In Firefox, go to `about:config` into your address bar and type `srgb` in the search bar. Double-click on `gfx.color_management.native_srgb` so it switches to `true`. Then, restart your browser.

![[color-precision-31.png]]

#### Other browsers

If you are using another browser, it's either not color managed, or you know how to look up the solution.

### Obsidian

In Obsidian, go to your user settings in the bottom left. Click on `About` in the sidebar and make sure to turn `Hardware acceleration` OFF. Your Obsidian will need to be restarted.

![[color-precision-47.png]]
![[color-precision-48.png]]

> Left: `Hardware acceleration` ON | Right: `Hardware acceleration` OFF

### Figma

Currently there doesn't appear to be a viable way to turn off color management for the Figma desktop app. I suggest using the in-browser version of the app instead for color sensitive usage.

![[color-precision-52.png]]

> Left: Figma in Firefox (sRGB) | Right: Figma desktop (sRGB color profile)

You can try to set the color profile mode to `Display P3`, however this will instead slightly boost the saturation instead of displaying the colors accurately. This also affects how colors are exported, too.

![[color-precision-53.png]]

> Left: Figma in Firefox (sRGB) | Right: Figma desktop (Display P3 color profile)

### Discord

In Discord, go to your user settings in the bottom left. Click on `Advanced` in the sidebar and make sure to turn `Hardware Acceleration` OFF. Your Discord will restart automatically.

![[color-precision-33.png]]
![[color-precision-36.png]]

> Left: `Hardware Acceleration` ON | Right: `Hardware Acceleration` OFF

### Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator

This one took a while to figure out because people online would explicitly say **not** to do this, and yet it ended up being the solution I needed.

To disable color management in Photoshop and Illustrator, simply go to `Edit` -> `Color Settings` and set the `Settings` dropdown to `Monitor Color`. Then, click `OK`.

![[color-precision-37.png]]
![[color-precision-40.png]]

If you want to undo this, simply change the `Settings` dropdown to `North America General Purpose 2`.

#### Save for Web, Quick Export, and Export As

When using the `Save for Web` feature, make sure to uncheck `Convert to sRGB`. This will keep images from exporting _too_ saturated.

![[color-precision-41.png]]

Before using the Quick Export feature, go to `File` -> `Export `-> `Export Preferences` and make sure to uncheck `Convert to sRGB`.

![[color-precision-50.png]]

When using the `Export As` feature, make sure to uncheck `Convert to sRGB`.

![[color-precision-51.png]]

### Clip Studio Paint

Clip Studio Paint is not color managed by default, however, if your colors in Clip Studio Paint look wrong, it is possible your Color Profile is turned ON.

To disable color management in Clip Studio Paint, simply go to `View` -> `Color Profile` and make sure `Preview` is OFF.

## Conclusion

I decided to write all this because color has been — and continues to be — a logistical nightmare to deal with. Hopefully, this guide will help clear up any confusion you may have about how to maintain color consistency. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to me!
